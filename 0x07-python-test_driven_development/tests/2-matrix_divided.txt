How to use 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

``matrix_divided(matrix, div)`` is a function that defines the matrix
and returns a list of the result.

Usage
=====

``matrix_divided(...)`` collects all elements from a matrix and divides
each element and return the list of result.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Note it is rounded to two decimal places

The original matrix is left unchanged

::

    >>> print(matrix)
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

The matrix can contain both int and floats

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, -4.2, 6, 4.4, 5],
    ...     [-9.9, 8.00, 8, 9.999, 1]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, -1.4, 2.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-3.3, 2.67, 2.67, 3.33, 0.33]]

Invalid Matrices
================

``matrix_divided(..)`` can contains list of list of integer and floats only
it will return TypeError

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ... ['6', 2],
    ... [8, 'z']
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

the rows must be of the same size 

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ... [1, 2, 3],
    ... [1, 2]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Invalid Divisors
===============
the div must be a number
and the value must not equl to 0

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ... [9, 11],
    ... [8, 2]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "number"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

div can't equal to 0

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ... [5, 1],
    ... [7, 2]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
